# Jack's Neovim config

Based off kickstart.nvim. Added some plugins and extracted it out of the massive init.lua file. I am extremely new to Neovim (and vim motions) so I expect to change this a lot as I move off of Visual Studio Code.

I've kept a lot of the comments so I have a quick reminder of what each setting does. These will be deleted as I learn more.

## To-do
- Add AI features to bring the experience closer to something like Cursor or Copilot.
- Change theme (currently using vscode - while I move off)
- More custom remaps
